SYNCHRONOUS SOCKETS

This sockets are working in softirq context, so context switches and memory
footprint are reduced.

The API is inconsistent by nature since it uses upcalls and downcalls at once
(in difference with Berkeley Socket API which uses downcalls only).
It uses upcalls to react on socket events (new data arrived, connection error
etc) and downcalls to perform user operations (e.g. connect to a host).
